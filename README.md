# [DEPRECATED AND ARCHIVED]

Ahhh... God I hate Vibe Coding

Sorry, this was my experiment trying to vibe code and like...

***It's impossible to maintain***

I mean, good lord, what was these AI **thinking**!???!

It's literally just an HTML viewer with an LLM Slapped On It!!! 

No need for... Bloody React Component, GEEZ!!!

. . .

Sorry for the rant, just... Head on over to the https://github.com/Iteranya/Aina-Discord-Bot for working Website Builder

Or just use Deepsite by Huggingface...

Wait, no...

Yeah, this project works, don't get me wrong, you can install and run it. But like... it's not maintained, I'm redoing this from scratch, with Python.
