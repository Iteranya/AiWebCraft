# AI Website Builder (No UI Skills Required) 🤖💅
(((I mean, if you're using it for front end dev use ***Some*** UI Skill would be required))

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b14efe8c-dff1-41dc-8336-fa2450ccd766)


A website builder crafted by someone who **actively refuses** ((Look I just don't have the time okay???)) to learn HTML, CSS, or JS. Why bother when AI can do it for you? Built with Replit ((Like, 99% by Replit)), Vite, and pure spite for front-end development. Inspired by [Deepsite AI](https://huggingface.co/spaces/enzostvs/deepsite) ((And many others, but Deepsite is open source!!)).

## Features ✨

- **Two Panels, Zero Talent**:
  - Left: Raw HTML generated by AI (pray it works). ((Depends on your AI, really, I use the newest Deepseek v3, works like a charm~))
  - Right: Instant preview (where miracles happen... sometimes). ((Just tone down your expectation))

- **AI Prompt (Bottom Left)**:
  - Write prompts like _"Make a website for my cat's bakery"_ or _"Create a 90s Geocities disaster"_. ((You want to be a bit more specific than this))
  - Be **VERY SPECIFIC**. The AI is judgy and literal. ((The AI isn't judgy, it's just... 'Generic'))

- **LLM Settings (Top Right)**:
  - Plug in your AI endpoint and API key. No API? Good luck. ((Openrouter has free Deepseek I think, go check it out. I think have chutes as default??? Bit weird but eh~))

- **CSS/JS Tabs (For Show)**:
  - The AI ignores these (it’s busy backflipping over your CSS requests). ((At first, the Generated code by Replit makes the AI make CSS here, but then I figured that, deepsite does it better by using a single monolithic html, easier for AI to understand))
  - Add inline styles or scripts manually if you’re feeling brave. ((Or just  do it in your dev server~))

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone this repo (or don’t—Replit already did most of the work). ((Oh that's cute, Deepseek R1 (the one that makes this READ ME) still thinks I only use replit for hosting. Nah fam, I used it for building everything!!!))
2. `npm install` (to install the 1,000 dependencies Vite needs). ((Just a few dozen, come on))
3. `npm run dev` (default port: **8844**—because why pick a normal one?). ((. . . Look, I have Silly Tavern, A1111, and a few others running, gotta make room aight???))

## Usage 🎩

1. **Prompt the AI**:
   - Examples:
     - _"Make a greeting card for my grandma who loves dragons."_ ((You might want to fix any broken image link))
     - _"Create a placeholder HTML component that looks less sad than my UI skills."_ ((Specify that you want a div or a section or something))
     - _"Turn this 10,000-word essay into a gorgeous website. Yes, all of it."_ ((This works way ,way, way better than I expected. Seriously, do try it))
   - Watch the AI generate HTML. Marvel at its patience. 

2. **Tweak Manually (Optional)**:
   - Use the **CSS/JS tabs** to add inline styles/scripts. The AI won’t judge you (but I will). ((I won't, pop off bestie))

## Configuration ⚙️

- **Top Right Corner**:
  - Set your LLM endpoint and API key (because free rides don’t last forever). ((It's not that expensive, really))
  - No idea what this means? [Insert shrug here].

## Tips & Tricks 🧠

- **The AI Can**:
  - Generate entire articles into websites (just paste and pray). ((My favorite feature))
  - "Backflip" over your CSS requests (metaphorically, sadly). 
  - Make placeholder components faster than you can Google "how to center a div". ((I mean, yes, that's true))
  - ((Oh another thing, you can put some html into the html bar and ask the AI to fix it and make it better~))

- **The AI Cannot**:
  - Fix your existential dread. ((You can try asking the AI "Make me a Website that fix my existential dread"))
  - Teach you front-end development (that’s the point). ((You can ask the AI to make a Front End Learning pipeline/syllabus))

---

## Known Quirks 😅

- The AI **ignores CSS/JS tabs**. It’s for your own good.
- Inline styles are your friend. The AI is not.
- Port 8844 is hardcoded because the dev forgot how to change Vite’s config. ((You know what? Fair))

## Acknowledgments 🙏

- The **Hugging Face team** for [Deepsite AI](https://huggingface.co/spaces/enzostvs/deepsite), which did this *way* better. ((Eh, I dunno, mine works locally, and you can even try using your Local AI to run it))
- **Replit** for hosting the chaos. ((For Making the whole thing, actually))
- **Coffee**, the real MVP. ((Have ya'll tried one of those Nescafe Espresso and some sweetened  flavored tea??? Best mocktail for lactose intolerant.))

> **Disclaimer**: This project was built by someone whose UI skills are outdone by a potato. Use at your own risk. (Also, it’s mostly TypeScript. Don’t ask why.) ((Web Dev Skills, not just UI Skills. If you check all my other project, the stuff I'm proud off has nothing to do with Web Dev whatsoever.))
