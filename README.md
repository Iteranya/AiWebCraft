# [DEPRECATED AND ARCHIVED]

Ahhh... God I hate Vibe Coding

Sorry, this was my experiment trying to vibe code and like...

I was curious what this 'vibe code' was all about ya know???

And I thought, hey, this seems like a simple enough project that an AI should be able to make. So why not give it a go??

I fire up Replit and start vibin', no coding cuz that's how it should be... And...

I found out the hard way that:

***It's impossible to maintain***

I mean, good lord, what was these AI **thinking**!???!

It's literally just an HTML viewer with an LLM Slapped On It!!! 

No need for... Bloody React Component, GEEZ!!!

It's over engineered to the stratosphere!!! GOOD LORD!!!

What the hell am I looking at?!

. . .

Sorry for the rant, just... Head on over to the https://github.com/Iteranya/Aina-Discord-Bot for working Website Builder

That one has some AI generated code with sane man-made architecture

Or just use Deepsite by Huggingface...

Wait, no...

Yeah, this project works, don't get me wrong, you can install and run it. But like... it's not maintained, I'm redoing this from scratch, with Python.
